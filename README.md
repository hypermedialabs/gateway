# Quick installation using Vercel (recommended)

For this installation we will have 2 ways to do it, the first one with a button to do it directly using the vercel dashboard or the second one using the Vercel CLI.

## Using the Vercel dashboard

1.  Click on the following button:
    [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?**repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fhello-world**)

2.  Finish the whole deployment process in Vercel and then copy the public url from here ![enter image description here](https://kpuytupfffedzdqkabsx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/Documentation%20Images/SCR-20240117-injs.png)

3.  Go to Configuration -> Environment Variables

4.  Set the `HYPERMEDIA_API_KEY` variable that has been created in [Hypermedia Access Keys Section](https://hypermedia.link/account/accesskeys)

5.  Set the `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` variable which is an array of strings with all domains authorized to get the upload information using their `HYPERMEDIA_API_KEY`. For example: ["https://server-uploader.vercel.app"]. Please do not add `localhost` domains in **production environments**.

This is how your environment variables section should look like at the end

At this point your server is ready to return to your client the necessary information to upload files using the [TUS Protocol](https://tus.io/).

6.  Now just go to your client and using the `@hypermedialabs/uploader` library paste the URL generated by vercel into the code. Here you have an example to use in the **client**:

        const uploader = useHypermediaUploader('https://server-uploader.vercel.app/api/upload-information',
        {
        	onProgress: (progress: number) => {
        		console.log("PROGRESS", progress)
        	},
        	onError: (error: any) => {
        		console.log("ON ERROR", error)
        	},
        	onSuccess: (response: any) => {
        		console.log("ON SUCCESS", response)
        	},

        	// Others options
        	...
        });

        const handleChange = (event: any) => {
        	// Here is you add your video
        	uploader.addFile(event.target.files[0]);
        };
